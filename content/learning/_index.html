      <h2>Learn Emergency Medical Skills Customized To You</h2>
      <p>
        I have more than a decade of experience teaching emergency medical
        skills to students from all backgrounds. I have been and emergency
        medical technician for many years and I am a senior medical student at
        Stanford now, where I teach basic life support and CPR and used to
        teach wilderness first aid.
      </p>
      <p>
        I offer some pre-scheduled group classes in <a href="/learning/cpr">CPR</a>
        and <a href="/learning/first-aid">first aid</a>, but the main thing that
        I offer are customized classes for you and your friends or loved ones to
        learn together. I can combine CPR (with or without a certification), first
        aid, and wilderness medicine instruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        These classes can be done in your home or, particularly for wilderness
        medicine classes, in outdoor parks in the Bay Area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pricing depends on the class and number of students, but starts at
        around $50 a person for just CPR and goes up to around $200 a person
        for a full weekend course including multiple elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also offer mass-classes for free, for example for schools. Please
        <a href="/contact">contact me</a> if you would like more info.
