      <h1>Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Instruction</h1>
      <p>
        I am an American Heart Association (AHA) certified CPR instructor and I
        teach CPR for professionals (BLS) and lay responders (Heartstart).
      </p>
      <p>
        I also offer mass-classes for free, for example for schools. Please
        <a href="/contact">contact me</a> if you would like more info.

                Basic life support, or BLS, is intended for professionals who work
                in the healthcare field and need to be trained to respond in an
                emergency.

                Heartstart CPR is intended for anyone who wants to be able to
                respond in an emergency. It is great when combined with first
                aid training.

            Basic life support teaches the skills to keep someone alive after
            their heart has stopped.
            It differs from <a href="#Heartstart">heartstart CPR</a> in that it
            also teaches airway management skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            This course is intended for anyone with a higher chance of encountering
            a patient whose heart has stopped for medical reasons, such as life
            guards, emergency medical technicians, and non-medical staff at medical
            facilities. It is also necessary, along with Advanced Cardiac Life
            Support (ACLS) for medical providers, such as nurses, paramedics,
            physician assistants, and physicians.

            Heartstart CPR teaches you how to do CPR on any adult or child of
            any age. All people should know CPR. It can save the people you love
            and give you the power to help strangers in need.

            I teach this course at a discounted rate to encourage more people to
            be trained. I also am willing to teach it for free in some situations,
            although I cannot provide a certification if it is taught for free.
          </p>
          <p>
            This class is 100% in-person. If done for a certification, some
            portions are taught via a pre-recorded video from the AHA. If no
            certification is needed, the course is taught entirely by me and at
            a discounted rate (the cost of the certification from the AHA is $20).
