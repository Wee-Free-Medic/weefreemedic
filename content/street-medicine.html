        I believe strongly in helping people avoid this crisis, but also in
        helping them get out of it. This is a challenging problem because of
        the nature of modern drugs, which are often used for self-medication by
        desperate individuals. These drugs, particularly opioids and
        methamphetamine, create usage disorders that push individuals to use
        even when their lives are being destroyed. This makes care very
        difficult, as relapse and self-destruction are just part of the
        disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, without support, these individuals end up bouncing in and
        out of jail and the emergency department until a severe illness or
        accident finishes them off.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a solvable problem that we as a society have created by
        non-sensical drug and housing policy. While my work will not solve the
        core issues that lead to this problem, it does reduce the risk of death
        and serious disease amongst those who I serve.

      <p class="lead">
        America's struggle with homelessness and potentially lethal drug
        dependence is long and complex. Since the 1970's people with complex
        mental health issues have been "de-institutionalized"&mdash; initially
        billed as a kindness to prevent forced confinement, but without any
        real funding for caring for those who struggle to care for themselves
        but are not a direct danger to themselves or others. The result is that
        now a substantial burden of mental health struggle takes place on the
        streets with minimal support.  Homeless shelters, while valuable for
        many, are notoriously dangerous to the point that many prefer the
        streets.

          <p>
            Added to this are the ups and downs of the economy in a country
            with confusing social supports (many live on disability, but some
            who really need it struggle to access it).  In the San Francisco
            Bay Area, where I live, the cost of housing has become completely
            unaffordable, resulting in large increases in homelessness whenever
            there is an economic downturn.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the
            rate of homelessness in this area increased by nearly 40%.
          </p>
          <p>
            This situation is made more complex by the rise of very strong
            recreational drugs. In the 1990s and 2000s, the Sackler family
            directed Purdue Pharma to fraudulently market OxyContin as a
            'non-addictive' pain killer, which is a lie. They then pushed the
            drug on physicians and consumers with extremely aggressive
            marketing practices. This directly resulted in a massive increase
            in addiction to opioids in our country, partially fueled by the
            loss of jobs to other countries and the increasing cost of living
            and fragmentation of society. Drug traffickers took advantage of
            this state of affairs and produced first highly potent heroin and
            then a variety of super-powerful fentanyl analogs.  As doctors
            realized they had been lied to, they stopped prescribing
            prescription pain pills, and addicts were shunted to these
            dangerous alternatives. Unfortunately, at the same time the Mexican
            government clamped down on ephedrine importing resulting in the
            development of a new method of synthesizing meth that uses harsh
            chemical instead.  This new method resulted in a very different
            drug, rather than being a euphoric party drug, it instead resulted
            in a dramatic upsurge in psychosis, serious mental health problems,
            and heart failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of the above, huge numbers of people died and many more
            ended up on the street with new severe addiction, mental health
            crisis, and health issues. Those who were already homeless,
            particularly those with existing mental health struggles, suddenly
            had extremely dangerous cheap drugs available, which killed them in
            record numbers, triggered psychosis, and made it even harder for
            them to access services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we live in a world with booming homelessness and overlapping
            drug addition. The SF bay area has more services available for
            these communities than the vast majority of this country, but it is
            still not enough. This is particularly true now as the most
            vulnerable&mdash;those struggling with homelessness, addiction, and
            mental health issues&mdash;are much less likely to travel to access
            services. Many remain on the street and self-medicate with a mix of
            substances. These people have a very high burden of health issues
            including chronic wounds and chronic medical conditions, but little
            access to care in part because of their addictions. Although, even
            those with no substance addictions can still struggle.
