          <h1>What is Harm Reduction?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p class="lead mb-3">
            Harm reduction is the idea of implementing a partial solution to reduce the amount of destruction (or harm) created by human behaviors when there is
            not a good way to actually fully stop or fix those behaviors in the moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good example of this from regular medicine is the use a medication such as metformin (a safe and common diabetes medication) in someone who has
            diabetes due to excess weight, insufficient exercise, and an unhealthy diet. Ideally, this person would be able to use diet and exercise to reverse
            the process of diabetes, and this is the ultimate goal, but there are very real reasons why this is very hard for people. For many people there are
            large genetic factors, cultural attitudes towards food are also really important, as are factors like stress, chronic pain, difficulty accessing gyms,
            etc. As a doctor, the goal is to try to help people get toward that ideal and live their healthiest lives. However, in the meantime, it does not make
            sense to allow people to accumulate the devastating consequences of diabetes as punishment for not being able to achieve "true success" in beating
            diabetes. That is cruel and unethical when there are safe treatments that can dramatically reduce the negative effects of diabetes and preserve health
            and life.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12">
            <p>
              The same logic applies with substance use, chronic pain, and homelessness. Ideally, a healthy person would use no recreational substances or
              pharmaceuticals, live a healthy life, have a job and an income, live in a nice home, and have no psychiatric issues. That is the goal for everyone,
              but the reality of the world we live in is that that is not accessible for many.
            </p>
            <p>
              The issues of substance use, chronic pain, trauma, psychiatric struggle, and homelessness are close to my heart and very complex. Far to complex to
              adequately describe here. Suffice to say, there are many reasons why people use substances; the most common is self-medication because of bad things
              in life—homelessness itself, depression, psychosis (e.g. schizophrenia), chronic pain, etc. There are also many reasons people end up without a stable
              place to live. Economic reasons are usually the primary initiators: housing is just too expensive, jobs can be hard to come by for some. Usually there
              are other factors too; many people have lots of childhood trauma that make it difficult to find stable work because they make people nervous, there is
              a lot of bias in the world against those with convictions, even for minor drug use, and with cultural expressions that don't fit our norms; those
              people can really struggle to find work. Chronic pain and psychiatric struggles can make things even harder. Of course, there are some whose drug use
              itself, due to genetic and environmental susceptibility, makes it very hard to hold together a stable life—this is particularly true with the advent
              of modern P2P methamphetamine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regardless of the reason why an individual finds themselves homeless initially, once unhoused it is extremely difficult to self-extricate. Banks and
              jobs require addresses, rented housing requires credit. It is an uphill battle. Worse, the streets in the western USA are now flooded with dirt cheap
              P2P methamphetamine, which can induce psychosis and paranoid extremely easily, and fentanyl, which is highly addictive and rapidly lethal. Once
              unhoused, it is difficult to avoid these substances, which can provide substantial relief from the psychic pain of a hard life. As a result, many
              people (absolutely not all) end up without stable housing, with some psychiatric and physical disease, and with an addiction to a substance.
            </p>

        <div class="row">
          <p>
            Ideally, we would be able to fully pull such people out of their situation, but to do so would require tackling all the issues that have landed them
            in that life <em>simultaneously</em>, which, just as with someone with diabetes, can be intractable—particularly in the US, where resources are
            limited.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, just as with diabetes, we have safe and effective interventions to reduce the amount of harm suffered by people with addictions and unstable
            housing that can substantially mitigate the damage of their life situation even without fully eliminating the problem. Ideal harm reduction solutions
            reduce the negative consequences of the dangerous behaviors that make things worse for people. For example, providing naloxone—an opioid overdose
            reversal agent—for people to save each other's lives in the event of an overdose. Other examples include providing needle exchange services to reduce
            the spread of disease from injection drug use. Ideally we would provide safe recreational drugs for those with substance use to use when they are
            unable to break their addictions—such as providing safe cannabis to reduce reliance on unsafe methamphetamine (safe methamphetamine would be the
            ideal, but that is legally and logistically impossible right now).
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a lot of cultural resistance to these ideas, some of it is well founded. There is a prevalent belief that making recreational drug use safer
            will encourage it and make addiction more common. This is a reasonable fear, but it falls into the same category as metformin making it easier for
            people to not eat well and do exercise. Is it OK to allow someone with diabetes to die 20 years younger because they struggle to get to the gym and
            eat healthy food when there is a drug that can spare them that? With homelessness and methamphetamine addiction, harm reduction strategies could
            potentially add even more life to someone's life than that, and give time and space for more comprehensive help to work. Is it ok to withhold that in
            order to try and force people to not use? No, it absolutely isn't. There is also now abundant evidence that that doesn't work. Use of increasingly
            dangerous substance continues to rise despite aggressive drug enforcement and a lack of harm reduction work. Places with legal use and better harm
            reduction actually have less addiction.
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold mb-3">
            For this reason I will continue to advocate for better harm reduction nation-wide, as well as more comprehensive and intelligent wrap-around services
            and drug policy. The reality of the modern US though is that this will likely continue to be an uphill battle, so in the meantime I am dedicated to
            doing what I can to advance the work of harm reduction volunteers everywhere, and to do what volunteering I can as well.

              Street medicine is related but orthogonal to harm reduction work. The two go hand-in-hand, but are not the same. Medical care is best provided in a
              clean and stable environment with adequate resources and support staff, so street medicine is always necessarily inferior to this gold standard.
              However, much as with harm reduction, letting the perfect exclude the good is not sensible. Street medicine thus brings medical care to the streets
              for those who are unwilling or unable to get to office-based care.

                Unfortunately, there are many providers in medicine still who have substantial bias against homelessness, chronic psychiatric disease, substance use
                disorders, and other related struggles. Furthermore, the structure of American medicine means that hospitals and clinics lose substantial amounts of
                money caring for uninsured or under-insured individuals, which creates a lot of pressure to "get them out". Humans are sensitive creatures and pick up
                on these often not-subtle messages, resulting in a decreased desire to return to hospitals and clinics. This is dramatically compounded when access
                itself is limited—how do you go to the doctor when you can't afford the bus and you lost your taxi vouchers and don't have a phone? Furthermore, as we
                have seen, mental health and the effects of modern dangerous substances on the street make it very difficult for some people to engage at all with
                medical care.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being unhoused is one of the most substantial risk factors for just about every chronic and serious disease there is, so these people need even more
                care, not less, but they get much less. The goal of street medicine is thus to try to provide 'in-home' care and house calls to those who don't have
                stable housing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Proper physician-level street medicine is a large and expensive undertaking, requiring a licensed doctor and supportive ancillary staff as well as
                wrap-around services to try to pull those who need it into clinical care and off the streets. Santa Clara already has such a program and is one of the
                few counties to do this well. Outside of this structure, full-spectrum street medicine can be more dangerous than valuable, diverting people from more
                substantial clinical resources towards less available options.

              As I am a medical student and have limited time and few resources, my current street medicine work is focused on a few limited objectives:

            <ul class="ps-3">
              <li>Providing real-time wound care for those who need it.</li>
              <li>Providing information, support, and transport to clinical services for those who struggle to get to clinic.</li>
              <li>Providing a supportive ear and EMT-level health advice (I am a certified EMT, but not yet a licensed physician) where desired.</li>
              <li>Simple harm reduction strategies as above, particularly naloxone, fentanyl test strip, warm clothing, and food distribution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I am also dedicated to supporting the work of other volunteer groups by providing teaching for free for anyone who wants it.
