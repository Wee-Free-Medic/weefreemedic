# Simple Policy

I will not sell or give your information to anyone ever for any reason unless
you have explicitly asked me to.

I collect email addresses, phone numbers, and other information about you for
the purpose of administering classes. If you do a class with me or donate any
money I will maintain records of the transaction for at least 5 years. These
will be stored on encrypted media and are not accessible to anyone else.

If you contact me for any reason, the only info I will store will be your contact
information.

You can [contact me](/contact) at any time to request the removal of your information.

This site is very simple. It collects minimal cookies for the function of forms
